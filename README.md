jsFormation
===========

An AWS CloudFormation Template Generator

State of Development
===========
Very, very, very, very early in the development stages. Barely any functionality.

How to help?
============
There are two ways to help:

1. By using it and reporting bugs and/or feature requests.
2. By helping with the coding and testing.
If you choose to help with coding and testing, you'll need at least the following:

Git (of course),  NodeJS, Yeoman, Grunt, SaSS and Compass. You'll also need the up-to-date angular and karma templates.

So, assuming you have all prequisites properly installed, do:

1. Fork this repo.
2. If you wish to add a new controller use `yo angular:controller MyControllerName`
3. If you wish to add a new view use `yo angular:view myViewName` (don't add .html)
4. If you just want to mess with the code/views already there, then go for it.
5. After you run `grunt` without errors or warnings (which includes unit tests), push to your fork and open and pull request.

Where can I see it in action?
